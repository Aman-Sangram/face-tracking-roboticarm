# face-tracking-roboticarm
Built a system capable of recognizing a face and then tracking it using live video from an external  webcam. The coordinates of the webcam are then fed to the robotic arm (Dobot magician) which follows the  coordinates and mimics the movement of the face.

Sensing:  MATLAB- Computer Vision Toolbox

Control:  Program uses video to generate the data in form of coordinates
          Dobot uses the data obtained from the code.
          
Resources: Dobot & Webcam/Intel

Objective: 
System is capable to detect face of a person and is able to track using the webcam input.
System can recognise and track a particular face from a group of faces.
The robotic arm is able to track and mimic the movement of the face in the given workspace.
